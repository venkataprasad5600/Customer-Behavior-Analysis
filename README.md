Customer Behavior Analysis :
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior through segmentation and lookalike modeling. By leveraging customer profiles, transaction data, and product information, we identify meaningful clusters and recommend similar customers for targeted strategies.

Key Objectives
Customer Segmentation:
Some of Insights Gained from the data are :
1: Customers from South America form a large share of the customer base, followed by Asia and Europe. However, transaction frequency is relatively low in Europe compared to the other regions. 
   This suggests the potential for targeted promotional campaigns and localized offerings in Europe to boost sales.
2: Electronics and Books are the top-performing product categories in terms of sales volume and revenue contribution. 
   Products like "Sound Wave Headphones" and "Active Wear Smartwatch" have consistent demand
3: Transaction volumes peak during specific months, such as March, June, and August, indicating seasonal shopping behavior. 
   This pattern aligns with mid-year sales or holidays.
4: Customers often purchase Books and Home Decor items together, suggesting complementary purchasing behavior. 
   Bundling these products can drive sales.
5: Products priced between INR 300-500 see higher demand compared to higher-priced items. 
   Customers display price sensitivity when selecting premium products like "Home Sense Sweater."
6: Categories like Clothing and Home Decor have untapped potential with moderate sales.
   Increasing product variety and advertising these categories can help improve their performance.
 


Lookalike Modeling:
Top 3 similar customers for each user, along with their similarity scores.
Output stored in a CSV file (VenkataPrasad_Papadasu_Lookalike.csv).
